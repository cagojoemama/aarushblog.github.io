    <p>Q1) What is a computer network?

        A computer network is a bunch of computers connected together so they can share stuff like files and messages.
        
        Q2) Explain IP address and DNS
        
        An IP address is like a computer's special internet address, while DNS helps us use easy-to-remember names to find websites by translating them into IP addresses.
        
        Q3) Explain URL in detail
        
        A URL is the address you type into your web browser to go to a website. It has parts like "http://" (or "https://"), the domain name (like google.com), and specific addresses for different pages on the site. It's like a set of directions for finding a place on the internet.</p>
